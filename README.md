# Cartoonify_reality

Even the basics of image processing if done properly can be handy which otherwise would require a machine learning model.This project is one of such inspiration which **cartoonizes** images and videos using only core **opencv filters** and functions.It also uses K-means clustering algorithm to compress the image. This clustering gives it the basic cartoonish tinge it requires.

**Algorithm**- K_Means Clustering

**Filters**-Bialateral Filter, Contours, erode, Canny(edge detection)


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```

```

## Getting Started

Download a python interpeter preferable a version beyond 3.0. Install the prerequisute libraries given above. Run vid.py file to cartonify your webcamp feed. Uncomment the last 2 lines of cartoonize.py and run to cartoonify an image.

```
$vid.py     
                    
$cartoonize.py
```
